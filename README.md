# Basic Actix Web Server


## What is this?
One of my initial attempts to build a REST API using Rust that I would use with my personal website. Now it serves as a template for other
backend projects where efficiency is vital.


## Can I borrow from this?
Absolutely. This was made mostly for experimentation, so you can fork or clone this repo and do whatever with it.


## Contributing
